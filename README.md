# Workflow-Index

Workflow is the process which items of work go through in order to be recorded and moved around on their journey to being complete. 
Each item of work is prioritised, routed and the obtained by a member of staff to be processed.

This index contains the latest 'master prototype', as well as the supporting prototypes - which we have used to test each function thoroughly with our users.
