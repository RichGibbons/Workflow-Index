        <p>
            Workflow is the process which items of work go through in order to be recorded and moved around on their journey
            to being complete. Each item of work is prioritised, routed and the obtained by a member of staff to be processed.

        <p></p>

        <p>The purpose of this prototype is to establish whether the proposed language for ‘Next Action’ where a caseworker is assigned and receives work using the Manage Assigned function meets user needs.</p>
        <p>This is to bring the language used for referrals and assigned work in line with each other.</p>
        <p>The proposed Next Action language is ‘Consider assignment from <assignee name>’</p>

        <p></p>
        <p>Executive Register Updates will introduce four new categories of work.</p>
        <p>The purpose of this prototype was to explore the usability of the components for choosing a category of work with users using two prototypes.</p>
        <p>In particular we wanted to focus on the time taken and ease of completion of the task of selection of categories using both prototypes to ascertain which is more efficient and meets user needs.</p>
